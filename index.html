                    <h2>About me:</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Portland OR based programmer</p>
                    <p>I've worn several powerful hats during my lifetime.  I've been a technician with the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/"><strong>USDA</strong></a> working with a department studying the uses of parasitic insects as a pesticide alternative.  I've been a <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com"><Strong>Krav Maga</Strong></a> practitioner for almost a decade teaching people from all walks of life how to be safer and to defend themselves.  Then I became an acupuncturist, and spent time in places like Nepal, as well as Portland, working as health care provider to underserved communities</p>
                    <p>Today I come to you as a <span class="emphasize">developer</span>.</p>
