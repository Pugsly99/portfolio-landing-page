                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p>I'm a Portland OR based programmer.</p>
                <p>I've worn several powerful hats during my lifetime.  I've been a technician with the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/"><strong>USDA</strong></a> working with a department studying the uses of parasitic insects as a pesticide alternative.  I've been a <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com"><Strong>Krav Maga</Strong></a> practitioner for almost a decade teaching people from all walks of life how to be safer and to defend themselves.  Then I became an acupuncturist, and spent time in places like Nepal, as well as Portland, working as health care provider to underserved communities</p>
                <p>Today I come to you as a <span class="emphasize">developer</span>.</p>
                <p>I decided to jump into the world of development once I realized it most aligned with my lifestyle.  I want to have the ability to travel and potentially live in other parts of the world and I think coding and tech is the best way to go about it</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>When not coding here's a list of a couple of my favorite activities:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cooking some recipe I found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></li>
                            <li>Throwing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGTjEpmhVmW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">kettlebells around for fun and fitness.</a></li>
                            <li>Exploring one of the many culinary delicacies <a href="https://pdx.eater.com/">Portland</a> has to offer.</li>
                        </ul>
